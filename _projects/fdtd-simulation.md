This project involved implementing a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation from scratch using the Yee lattice formulation. The implementation includes:

- **Parallelized computation** for improved performance
- **Yee lattice formulation** for accurate electromagnetic field calculations
- **Visualization tools** for field distribution analysis

The FDTD method is a numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations at all points in discretized space as time evolves from one instant to the next, making it particularly useful for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation in complex media and geometries.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python with NumPy and multiprocessing
- **Key Features**: Parallel processing, field visualization
- **Applications**: Electromagnetic simulation, optical device design, wave propagation analysis

This project demonstrates fundamental understanding of computational electromagnetics and parallel computing (vectorization) techniques.
