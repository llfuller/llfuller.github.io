This project focused on implementing the MEEP (MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation) open-source optics simulation library with parallel processing capabilities. The work included:

- **Multi-core CPU optimization** for simultaneous processing
- **Performance benchmarking** for runtime vs different total CPU core amounts

MEEP is a prior existing free and open-source software package for electromagnetic simulation by the FDTD method, developed at MIT. This project was practice to become familiar with the package.

## Technical Achievements

- **Parallel Processing**: Successfully tested on multiple simultaneous CPU cores

## Applications

- Optical device design and analysis
- Waveguide optimization
- Metamaterial characterization

This project showcases ability to pick up existing, and more widely-used, simulation packages that implement the simulation, after having just prior coded the physics simulation from scratch.
