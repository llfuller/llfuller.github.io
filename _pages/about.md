# Lawson L. Fuller, Ph.D.

## Research Interests
I am a computational physicist working at the intersection of **physics‑based simulation, computational neuroscience, and machine learning**. My projects range from electromagnetic simulation, to graphs of interacting dynamical systems, to data‑driven modeling of biological neurons. I'm most interested in finding novel methods of computation using any available physical systems in order to create future computational technologies with greater ability and lower time and energy costs.

## Experience
### Computational Physicist — **Imagia** (Jun 2024 – Jul 2025)  
Developed an end‑to‑end Python pipeline for electromagnetic design, cutting setup time from 8 h to ≈ 100 s (300x speedup), performed pre-processing and analysis of experimental data, and coordinated across design, fabrication, and experimental teams.

### AI Scientist (Contractor) — **Ascend OS** (Feb 2025 – Apr 2025)  
Architected an agentic LLM backend (LangGraph) that generated personalized ice‑breaker content for a nearly 100‑person corporate event.

### Research Assistant Intern — **Lawrence Berkeley National Lab** (Aug 2017 – Mar 2018)  
Implemented C++ ROOT analyses for ATLAS collaboration; built Python visualization tools for the Particle Data Group and was credited in the *Review of Particle Physics 2018*.
